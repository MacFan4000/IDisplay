# Extension:IDisplay

The '''iDisplay''' extension allows MediaWiki pages to embed external web pages.
It also allows setting an option to put a blocking page in front of it,
so you prevent loading the page until the user wants to load the page.

Security
--------

Well, let's not pretend that the extension is safe at this point.  This
allows you to embed another website, any website, in the middle of your wiki.

Currently, this should only be used on private wikis with restricted editing.
Don't let anyone edit it who you wouldn't give a commit bit or a key to your workplace.
